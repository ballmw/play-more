Welcome to Play More!
=====================

I created this application because I wanted to see if I could create a fitness tracker with HTML5. I've used native apps RunKeeper and iWander, but I wanted to see if I could build a webapp with the same capabilities. I'd like to be able to click "Start" and have my time and distance tracked, as well as some good tunes flowing to my ears.

If you'd like to hear more about how I built this app, please [view my presentation from Devoxx 2011](http://www.slideshare.net/mraible/html5-with-play-scala-coffeescript-and-jade-devoxx-2011 "Slideshare Presentation") titled [HTML5 with Play/Scala, CoffeeScript and Jade](http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV11/HTML5+with+Play+Scala%2C+CoffeeScript+and+Jade title="Video Footage on Devoxx.com") or [read my articles](http://raibledesigns.com/rd/tags/devoxx2011) about building it.
